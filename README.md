# My advent of code

## 2020: have a bash!
This year I tried to solve the games in `bash scripting`... 2020 has not been an easy year ;)

- Part 1 of all enigms is solved in bash.

- Part 2 of most games is also solved in bash.

Where I could not find a clever way to solve Part 2 in `bash` with an efficient program, I solved it Python.
This happened basically when working withoult multi-dimensional arrays (lacking in bash) was extremely slow or tedious.

There is no part 2 solution fot the problems from days 22 to 24. If I had to provide a solution for those days, it would be in python.
